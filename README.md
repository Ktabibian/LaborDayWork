Notes
Beersong:  The solution was to move the //if (beerNum == 1){word = "bottle";} to before the if...else statement.
	This helped conceptualize order of opertations and how a class very specifically will read lines as they
	are typed out.  The exercise always established how just because the class is running smoothly doesn't
	mean it is optimal.
Phraseomatic:  From this I learned that java is smart enought to randomly call on an index withing an array's
	limitations.  I also learned about Math library which a java library full of functions used to expand on
	operator functions.  I also learned about libraries.
Video:  This was simply just more practice with parameterized coonstructors, attributes, and creating new objects.
Movie:  Better practice to initialize your attribute using a parameterized constructor rather than initializing
	the attributes inside the main.
